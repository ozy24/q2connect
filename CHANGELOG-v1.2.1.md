# Q2Connect v1.2.1

## Downloads

- **Q2Connect-v1.2.1-full.zip** (recommended) – Contains the needed .NET 10 runtime files within the executable.
- **Q2Connect-v1.2.1-lite.zip** – Smaller in size but requires a separate .NET 10 runtime install from:
  [.NET 10 Desktop Runtime (Windows x64)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-10.0.2-windows-x64-installer)

Both releases are otherwise identical.

## Changes since v1.2.0

### Settings window

- **Dividers** added between sections (Quake 2 Executable, Master Server, Options, Advanced) with reduced spacing.
- **Section headings** use a slightly smaller font (11pt) for GroupBox headers.

### Log window
